### An SPA framework add on for VanJS

ðŸ”¥ **Van Cone plus VanJS can create a fully featured SPA app that minifies and gzips 3.82 kB!** ðŸ”¥

This lightweight (less than 200 lines) VanJS addon adds the following features:
- Navigation powered by custom router with async loading
    - url and query param parsing
    - integrates with browser history
    - state object that integrates with browser history
    - determine current active route
    - define different backend endpoints for fetching data if different than route's front end url
- `link` component for generating links based off of named routes
    - easily add url and query params as objects
    - dynamic css styling for active route
    - pass additional context data such as a prefetched data or other configuration to route component

### ðŸš¨ **Van Cone is in Beta** ðŸš¨

At this point API changes are not expected but possible, the API is almost frozen for a version 1. I'm waiting to take it out of alpha status until I have unittests written, now that I'm almost settled on the API, those are my next task. Also see contribution instructions below if you can contribute.

# Overview

Van Cone is a minimal framework that provides routing, history and a link component that provides dynamic styling for when it is the active link.

There is only one exported function which is used to create an application object. You provide it with the DOM element that will contain the app, a list of routes, and an optional default state for `window.history.state` and it returns an object with several SPA helper methods.

Install:
```bash
npm install van-cone
```
A basic hello world app requires javascript and HTML:

Example JS:
```javascript
import createCone from 'van-cone';
import van from 'vanjs-core';
const { div, p, span, hr } = van.tags;

// define page components
const homePage = () => div('Home Page')
const userPage = (params) => div('User Page', p('userId: ' + params.userId))

// define routes
const routes = [
  { path: '/',              name: 'home', callable: async () => homePage },
  { path: '/user/:userId',  name: 'user', callable: async () => userPage }
];

// create the spa object
const routerElement = div({ id: 'layout' })
const { link } = createCone(routerElement, routes)

// main app layout
const App = () =>
  div(
    link({ name: 'home' }, 'Home'),
    span(' | '),
    link({name: 'user', params: {userId: 123}}, 'User'),
    hr(),
    routerElement
  );

document.body.replaceChildren(App());
```

Example HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="description" content="Dialog Modal component with VanJS" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>VanJS Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./src/index.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```
